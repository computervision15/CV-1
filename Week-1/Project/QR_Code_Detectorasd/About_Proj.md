## Assignment Instructions

It's time for you to put your skills to test. In this assignment, you will be building a QR Code Detector using OpenCV's functions. Since we have not discussed QR Codes before, we will be providing you with some hints including which OpenCV function you can use.

### Note that the output of your code should match the expected output exactly.

This assignment carries **30 points** and the marks distribution is as follows:

1. Image read correctly - 6 points

2. Created a QRCodeDetector object with correct variable name - 6 points

3. Detect QR Code in the image - 6 points

4. Print decoded text - 6 points

5. Final output image saved correctly - 6 points

### You get 5 attempts to complete the assignment
